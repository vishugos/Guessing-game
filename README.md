This is a fun and interactive Guessing Game implemented in Java. The game works as follows:
Game Objective:
<br>
1) The player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2) Random Number Generation:
The program uses Java's Random class to generate a random number, ensuring unpredictability and fairness.
3) User Input:
The player provides their guesses through the console.
4) Feedback on Guesses:
After each guess, the program gives feedback:

Too High: If the guess is higher than the target number.
Too Low: If the guess is lower than the target number.
5) Winning Condition:
The game continues until the player guesses the correct number. Once the player guesses correctly, a congratulatory message is displayed along with the total number of attempts.
6) Optional Features:

The program can include a maximum number of attempts to make the game more challenging.
It can display the option to play again after the game ends.

7) At ever attempt it shows how many chances are left for player.
8) This game is a great way to practice working with loops, conditionals, user input, and random number generation in Java.
